# GitHub Workshop

Introduction to Git and GitHub

## Intro
⏰ 5 mins

Describe workshop at a high level.

Have participants introduce themselves and express what brought them here.

*✏️capture their reasons for being here*


## 🕺 Activity
⏰ 10 mins

Move participants to breakout rooms (~3 people/room) for discussion.
* How do you handle version control? (but in a less wonky way)
	* How have your experiences doing so gone?
* Have you worked on a project where git or GitHub was used?
	* How was your experience?
* Have you used or tried to use git or GitHub for your own purposes before?
	* How was your experience?

*✏️ each group will capture this info on a shared doc*


## 🗣️ Discussion
⏰ 5 mins

Back in the big group.  Allow participants to discuss their findings from the activity.

*✏️ capture shared experiences*


## 👨‍🏫 Input
⏰ 15 mins

Facilitator provides 
- a high-level overview of version-control and git,
	- branches, pull requests, and the like,
- the relationship between git and GitHub (mention other git-based hosting services, to at least decouple the two a bit in folk's minds),
- quick intro to GitHub desktop


## 🧠 Deepening
⏰ 20 mins

Breakout into small groups (~3 folks). Facilitator(s) will hop around breakout rooms to help out.

With a facilitator-curated collection of resources, notes, instructions and a starter repo, the groups will 
- write a sample page for a fake website
- use GitHub desktop to commit the changes to the project,
- publish it with a git push,
- make a pull request


## 🏭 Synthesis
⏰ 5 mins

Back in the big group.

Ask participants to share their experiences in the previous section.
	* What went right?
	* What went wrong?
	* Sticking points
	
*✏️ capture shared experiences*
